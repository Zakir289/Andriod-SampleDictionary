While writing the app its better to **ensure that your layout is flexible and adapts to different screen sizes**

*  you should use "wrap_content" and"match_parent" for the width and height of some view components. 

*  "wrap_content", the width or height of the view is set to the minimum size necessary to fit the content within that view
* "match_parent"  makes the component expand to match the size of its parent view.
* By using the "wrap_content" and "match_parent" size values instead of hard-coded sizes, your views either use only the space required for that view or expand to fill the available space, respectively.
